## ⚡ Updated 2-Day Gap Filler (No Coding Grind, Just Fundamentals)

### **Day 1 – React + TypeScript Core**

**Morning (2–3 hrs) – React Refresher**

* Props vs state (immutable vs mutable)
* useEffect dependencies (why `[count]` matters)
* Context API vs Redux (local vs global state mgmt)
* Controlled vs uncontrolled inputs
* Keys in lists (why React needs them)
* Error boundaries (catching render errors)

  ✅ Practice: write a small component with `useState`, `useEffect`, and context.

**Afternoon (2 hrs) – TypeScript Refresher**

* `interface` vs `type`
* Generics (functions + React components)
* Utility types (`Partial`, `Pick`, `Omit`, `Record`)
* Union vs intersection types
* `any` vs `unknown`
* Optional (`?`) and readonly

  ✅ Practice: convert a simple JS component to TS.

**Evening (1–2 hrs) – React + TS Mock Q&A Drill**

Answer out loud:

* What are React keys and why are they important?
* Difference between `useMemo` and `useCallback`?
* What problem do React hooks solve?
* How does TS improve React code quality?
* Difference between interface merging and type aliasing?

### **Day 2 – CS Fundamentals + System Design**

**Morning (2–3 hrs) – CS Fundamentals Crash**

* **Big-O basics** :
  * `O(1)` = constant (array index lookup)
  * `O(n)` = linear (loop through array)
  * `O(log n)` = binary search
  * `O(n²)` = nested loops (bubble sort)
* Arrays vs linked lists (contiguous vs scattered memory, indexing vs traversal)
* Hash maps (key → value, constant lookups, collisions handled with chaining)
* Recursion (factorial, tree traversal, when it’s useful vs iterative)
* Database indexes (why they make queries faster, trade-off = slower writes)
* REST: **POST vs PUT** (create vs update/replace)
* Virtualization: VM vs containers (isolation vs lightweight)

✅ Instead of LeetCode → just read **definitions + real-world examples** (e.g., “binary search is how autocomplete finds results fast”).

**Afternoon (2 hrs) – System & Patterns**

* MVC (separates concerns: model, view, controller)
* Singleton (one instance, e.g. global config object)
* Observer (subscriptions, like event listeners or Redux store)
* Factory (object creation wrapper)
* Client-server flow in a web app (browser request → server → DB → response)
* React rendering optimization: memo, lazy loading, suspense

✅ Practice: explain React render cycle in your own words.

**Evening (1–2 hrs) – Mock Interview Rehearsal**

* Use your mock sheet.
* Time-box answers to ~2 minutes.
* Record → listen → refine wording.
* End by practicing your **project story in STAR format** (Situation, Task, Action, Result).
