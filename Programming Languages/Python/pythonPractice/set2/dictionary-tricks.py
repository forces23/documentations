'''
    Problem #3 â€“ Word Frequency Counter

    Write a function word_count that takes in a string and returns a dictionary where the keys are words and the values are how many times each word appears.

    Example:
    word_count("the cat and the hat")
    # -> {'the': 2, 'cat': 1, 'and': 1, 'hat': 1}


    ðŸ‘‰ This is a dictionary trick because youâ€™ll need to use:

    .get(key, default) to avoid KeyErrors, or

    collections.defaultdict(int) to simplify counting, or

    collections.Counter for a super clean solution.

    # the only concern i seen was that for defaultdict it will create a new inset in the dict. that can be dangerous if you did want to do this 
    print(test1["a"]) # Counter will return 0 for missing keys (and adds the key into the dict).
    print("test2 will cause an error due to key not existing")
    # print(test2["a"]) # this will cause an error due to key not existing
    print(test3["a"]) # this will create a new insert in the dictionary with a default value of 0
    print()

    # NOTE: counter works similarly to defaultdict BUT Counter only returns 0 temporarily when missing, and wonâ€™t actually insert until you perform an update/assignment.

    print(test1)
