services to cover:

this is all the services i have notes about now:

Amzon Q, Amplify, Athena, AWS Networking Security, Bedrock, CloudTrail, CloudWatch, Connect, DynamoDB, ECS, EKS, EventBridge, GuardDuty, Glue, IAM, IAM Identity Center(IAMIC), kinesis, KMS, Lambda LEX, Macie, Quicksight, RDS, S3, SNS, SQS


here are the 3 major projects i have worked on at my last job:

## 🚀 Project 1: Real-Time Data Processing & Analytics Pipeline

**Your version:** Lambda → Kinesis → S3 → Glue → Athena → PowerBI

✅ This makes sense, just needs tightening. The flow would be:

* **Kinesis Data Stream** captures streaming data.
* **Lambda function** subscribed to Kinesis events manipulates/cleans data.
* Lambda stores processed data in  **S3** .
* **AWS Glue Crawler** catalogs the S3 data.
* **Athena** queries the data directly from S3 using the Glue catalog.
* Data Analysts use **Power BI** (via Athena connector or export) to create dashboards.

**How to phrase it in interview:**

> “I built a real-time analytics pipeline where Kinesis captured event data, Lambda processed and cleaned the data, and stored it in S3. From there, AWS Glue crawlers created the schema, and analysts queried the data through Athena and visualized it in Power BI. This automated pipeline significantly reduced manual data prep and improved reporting speed.”

## 🚀 Project 2: AI-Powered Chatbot for Contact Center

**Your version:** Lex + Bedrock + Connect + Amazon Q

✅ This is good, but let’s clarify the services:

* **Amazon Lex** = chatbot (text and voice).
* **Amazon Connect** = cloud contact center platform (where chat/voice happens).
* **Amazon Bedrock** = generative AI (used for knowledge retrieval, summarization, etc.).
* **Amazon Q** = AI assistant for customer support / call center agents.

**What you built:**

* Created a **Lex chatbot** integrated into **Amazon Connect** for customer chats.
* Enhanced it with **Bedrock knowledge base** so the bot could answer more complex questions.
* Extended the same flow to **voice interactions** in Connect.
* Added  **Amazon Q for agents** , which searched internal documents and surfaced answers with citations, improving efficiency and compliance.

**How to phrase it in interview:**

> “I developed a Lex chatbot integrated with Amazon Connect for customer interactions. I extended it to handle both chat and voice channels. I also integrated Bedrock’s knowledge base to provide smarter responses, and implemented Amazon Q for call center agents, allowing them to quickly search internal documents and receive AI-driven answers with citations. This significantly reduced call handling time and improved customer experience.”

## 🚀 Project 3: Application Revamp & Deployment on EKS

**Your version:** Frontend lead + worked with Cloud DevOps on EKS deployments

✅ This is spot on. You just need to clarify your **role** vs DevOps’s.

* You led the **frontend revamp** (React/TS, etc.).
* Worked with Cloud DevOps engineer to containerize and deploy the app.
* He built the Kubernetes YAML (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps, etc.), but you **reviewed and validated configs** to ensure they matched application needs (ports, environment variables, scaling, etc.).
* Entire app (frontend + backend) deployed on **Amazon EKS** (managed Kubernetes).

**How to phrase it in interview:**

> “I led the frontend redevelopment of our application and partnered with a Cloud DevOps engineer to deploy the full stack into Amazon EKS. While he handled the Kubernetes YAML manifests, I reviewed and validated them to ensure the configurations aligned with the app’s requirements. This project gave me strong exposure to containerized deployments, Kubernetes concepts, and cloud-native scaling.”

## 🎯 Why These 3 Work Well

* **Project 1 (Data Pipeline):** Shows you understand **serverless + data engineering** on AWS.
* **Project 2 (Chatbot + AI):** Shows you have **AI/ML, Connect, Bedrock, Lex, Q** — very modern & relevant.
* **Project 3 (EKS Deployment):** Shows you’ve worked with  **microservices in Kubernetes** , alongside DevOps, which ties into CI/CD and modern architectures.

  on top of these projects i have deploy applications on Amplfiy

  i want you to help me understand system architecture. so that i am able to build something in something like flow.io that outlines the whole design of a project. lets say that i need to build an application i would need to show in the architecture design ui the backend with the database(s) that i need to setup, if there is a chat bot i have to intergrate bedrock all this stuff.. kinda like the outline of the projects i have done listed above.
