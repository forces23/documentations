## Tips for Two Pointers Problems

1. **Identify the pattern**: Look for problems involving pairs, triplets, or subarrays/substrings.
2. **Consider sorting**: Many two-pointer problems become easier after sorting the input.
3. **Choose the right approach**:

   - Opposite-direction pointers (start and end)
   - Same-direction pointers (slow and fast)
   - Multiple arrays pointers
4. **Handle edge cases**: Empty arrays/strings, single elements, duplicates.
5. **Practice visualization**: Draw out how the pointers move through the data structure.

Happy coding!
