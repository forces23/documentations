## Tips for Sliding Window Problems

1. **Identify the window**: Determine what constitutes your "window" - is it a fixed size or variable?

2. **Window expansion and contraction**:
   - For fixed-size windows: Slide the window one element at a time
   - For variable-size windows: Expand until a condition is violated, then contract until it's satisfied again

3. **Track window state**: Keep track of relevant information about the current window (sum, count of elements, etc.)

4. **Optimize calculations**: When sliding the window, update the state incrementally rather than recalculating

5. **Common patterns**:
   - Fixed window size: Often used for averages, sums of fixed length
   - Variable window size: Often used for "longest/shortest subarray that satisfies condition X"
   - Window with constraints: Track additional state to ensure constraints are met

6. **Data structures**: Consider using:
   - HashMap/Counter for frequency of elements
   - Deque for maintaining ordered elements (especially for sliding window maximum/minimum)
   - Set for tracking distinct elements
