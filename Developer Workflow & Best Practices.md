# Version Control (Git & GitHub)

* **Core Concepts:** repositories, commits, branches, remotes
* **Branching Strategies:** feature branches, main/master, release branches
* **Pull Requests (PRs):** creating, reviewing, and merging PRs
* **Merge Conflicts:** identifying, resolving, and preventing conflicts
* **Key Commands:**

  * `git init`, `git clone`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`, `git pull`
  * `git checkout`, `git merge`, `git rebase`, `git log`, `git diff`
* **Best Practices:**

  * Commit early and often
  * Write clear, descriptive commit messages
  * Keep branches short-lived and focused
  * Review PRs thoroughly and provide constructive feedback

# IDE & Productivity Tools

* **VS Code (frontend focus):**

  * Extensions: Prettier, ESLint, GitLens, React Developer Tools
  * Integrated terminal, debugging, multi-cursor editing
* **IntelliJ IDEA (backend focus):**

  * Java/Spring Boot support, Maven/Gradle integration, debugging
  * Refactoring tools, live templates, version control integration
* **Best Practices:**

  * Customize IDE for efficiency
  * Use keyboard shortcuts and code snippets
  * Keep IDE and extensions updated

# Package Managers & Build Tools

* **Frontend:** npm, yarn

  * Install dependencies, run scripts, use lockfiles
* **Backend:** Maven, Gradle

  * Dependency management, build automation, plugins
* **Best Practices:**

  * Keep dependencies updated
  * Remove unused packages
  * Automate builds for consistency

# Testing & Quality Assurance

* **Unit Testing:** isolated tests for functions/components
* **Integration Testing:** test modules/services together
* **Frontend Testing:** Jest, React Testing Library, Vitest
* **Backend Testing:** JUnit, Mockito, Spring Boot Test
* **Best Practices:**

  * Follow TDD (Test-Driven Development) mindset
  * Write meaningful, maintainable tests
  * Automate tests in CI/CD pipelines
  * Ensure tests cover edge cases and errors

# Agile & Scrum Basics

* **Best Practices:**

  * Break tasks into small, manageable stories
  * Estimate effort with story points
  * Maintain clear communication and transparency
  * Adapt continuously based on feedback

# Workflow & Professional Best Practices

* Automate repetitive tasks: linting, testing, builds
* Follow code style and formatting standards
* Document code, APIs, and setup instructions
* Use feature branches and PRs for all changes
* Continuously learn and adopt new tools/techniques
