# ⚡ 1-Day Interview Prep Plan

**Goal:** Sharpen AWS + system design + leadership stories so you sound senior-level.

---

## 🕐 Morning (2–3 hours) → **AWS & Cloud Solutions Deep Dive**

Focus: Refresh AWS core services & architecture tradeoffs.

1. **Serverless & Event-Driven Patterns**
   * Lambda (cold starts, memory/cost tradeoffs).
   * SQS vs SNS vs EventBridge → when to use each.
   * DynamoDB (partition keys, scaling, transactions).
   * RDS vs DynamoDB → tradeoffs.
2. **Storage & Data Handling**
   * S3 (versioning, lifecycle policies, encryption, presigned URLs).
   * Secure handling of **financial data** → encryption (KMS), IAM least privilege.
3. **Security**
   * IAM best practices: roles, policies, permission boundaries.
   * VPC design: private subnets, NAT gateway, security groups.
   * Common compliance practices (PCI, SOC2, HIPAA → just high-level awareness).
4. **CI/CD & Automation**
   * IaC (CloudFormation/Terraform basics).
   * CodePipeline/CodeBuild/CodeDeploy.
   * Automated testing in deployment pipelines.

👉 Quick Exercise: Draw (on paper) a  **reference architecture** :

* Web app (React frontend) + API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB + S3 + CloudFront + Cognito + CloudWatch.

  Be ready to explain why you’d choose this setup.

## 🕐 Midday (2–3 hours) → **System Design & Problem Solving**

Focus: Think like a Senior Engineer in architecture discussions.

1. **System Design Practice Questions**
   * How would you design a **real-time event-driven financial transaction system** in AWS?
   * How would you **migrate a monolith to microservices** using AWS?
   * How would you design a **scalable, secure file upload/download service** with S3?
2. **Performance & Scalability**
   * Caching strategies (ElastiCache/CloudFront).
   * Database scaling (RDS read replicas, DynamoDB auto-scaling).
   * Monitoring & Observability (CloudWatch, X-Ray, alarms).
3. **Failure & Recovery**
   * Multi-AZ vs Multi-Region.
   * Blue/green deployments.
   * Circuit breaker & retry patterns.

👉 Tip: Always think in terms of **tradeoffs** (cost, performance, complexity, security).

---

## 🕐 Afternoon (2 hours) → **STAR Stories & Behavioral Prep**

Focus: Be ready for “Tell me about a time when…”

Prepare  **3–4 STAR stories** :

1. **Modernization**
   * Migrating or re-architecting a legacy system.
   * Key: why the old system was failing, what you changed, measurable outcome.
2. **Performance/Scalability Fix**
   * Example: improving response times, reducing AWS bill, optimizing DB queries.
3. **Security/Data Handling**
   * Example: working with financial or sensitive data, adding encryption, auditing.
4. **Team/Leadership**
   * Example: resolving a blocker, mentoring, improving agile delivery process.

👉 Use **metrics** when possible (e.g., “reduced latency by 40%,” “cut AWS cost by 25%”).

---

## 🕐 Evening (1–2 hours) → **Light Review + Mock Answers**

Focus: Confidence building.

* Review **AWS Well-Architected Framework** pillars (Operational Excellence, Security, Reliability, Performance Efficiency, Cost Optimization, Sustainability).
* Do 2–3  **mock Q&A aloud** :
  * “How would you design a scalable API on AWS?”
  * “Tell me about a time you solved a major production issue.”
  * “How do you secure data in AWS, especially financial data?”
* Quick refresh on **AI/ML services** (Bedrock, SageMaker). Don’t go deep, just know:
  * Bedrock = foundation model service.
  * SageMaker = build/train/deploy ML models.
  * How you’d integrate them into an application.

# ✅ Interview-Day Mindset

* Lead with **high-level architecture thinking** before diving into code.
* Always discuss **tradeoffs** (shows senior-level judgment).
* Communicate clearly with structure (STAR for behavioral, step-by-step for technical).
* Show confidence in  **AWS + secure cloud design** .
